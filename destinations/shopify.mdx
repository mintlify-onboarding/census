Connecting Shopify

Note: Census will only query Shopify based on the syncs/objects that you configure

1. 1.  
Census connects via OAuth, so you need a Shopify user that can login to the instance with the following permission scopes:  
| write\_products                               | read\_products                               |  
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |  
| write\_customers                              | read\_customers                              |  
| write\_orders                                 | read\_orders                                 |  
| write\_inventory                              | read\_inventory                              |  
| write\_fulfillments                           | read\_fulfillments                           |  
| write\_assigned\_fulfillment\_orders          | read\_assigned\_fulfillment\_orders          |  
| write\_merchant\_managed\_fulfillment\_orders | read\_merchant\_managed\_fulfillment\_orders |  
| write\_third\_party\_fulfillment\_orders      | read\_third\_party\_fulfillment\_orders      |

2. 2.  
There is some setup that is needed to do on the Census side to setup Shopify, while this process is under construction  
üèó  
, please [contact us](mailto:support@getcensus.com) via email or start a conversation with us via the [in-app](https://app.getcensus.com) chat with the topic: "Shopify Setup". In your communication please provide your Shopify Store URL so we can get started on your set up!

## üóÑ Supported Objects

Census currently supports syncing to the following Shopify objects ([Contact us](mailto:support@getcensus.com) if you're looking for more!):

| **Object Name** | **Supported?**  | **Sync Keys**  |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Customer        | ‚úÖ               | Email          |
| Fulfillment     | ‚úÖ               |               |
| Inventory Level | ‚úÖ               |               |
| Order           | ‚úÖ               | Source ID      |
| Product         | ‚úÖ               | Tag ID, Handle |
| Product Image   | ‚úÖ (via Product) |               |
| Product Variant | ‚úÖ               | SKU            |

Census also supports Shopify's Custom Metafields on Customer and Product as well.

#### Updating Product Images

Census supports setting product images by passing a [Arrays and Nested Objects](/basics/data-models-and-entities/defining-source-data/structured-data) Array to the `images` field on the Product. The images array needs to be a set of one more objects that contain URLs to each image you want to upload. It should look something like the following:

```
[
  { 
    "position": 1, 
    "src": "https://via.placeholder.com/300.png?text=iPod%20Nano,%208GB", 
    "width": 640, 
    "height": 480 
  }
]
```

Only the `src` field is required. `position`, `width`, and `height` are optional.
