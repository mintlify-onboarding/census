title: "ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin"
---

[ChatGPT Retrieval Plugins](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin) are an open source pattern for making data accessible to querying by ChatGPT. They require setting up a dedicated server to operate. Census communicates with this server to load the data you've synced. To configure one for your company, see our [blog post on using Census with ChatGPT Retrieval Plugins](https://census.dev/blog/turn-your-db-into-a-chatgpt-plug-in-with-census-and-fly).

Navigate to the **Destinations** page in Census and click **New Destination**.

2. 2.
