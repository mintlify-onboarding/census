## 🗄 Supported Objects

| **Object Name** | **Supported?** | **Sync Keys**          |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Customer List   | ✅              | Email, IDFA, MAID \*\* |

Note: [Pinterest requires](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/v5/#tag/customer%5Flists) emails to be lowercase and can be plain text or hashed using SHA1, SHA256, or MD5\. MAIDs and IDFAs must be hashed with SHA1, SHA256, or MD5\. You have the option to provide plain-text versions of any of these to Census and we will automatically hash the values before passing them along to Pinterest.
