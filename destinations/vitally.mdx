Census makes use of different Vitally APIs for different operations. You're welcome to only connect one or the other, but we suggest connecting both in case you change your mind down the road:

#### Analytics API

* Required for Update and Create (a.k.a. "Upsert") and Append syncs

* Navigate to `https://[your-domain].vitally.io/integrations/api`

* Select **Integration via HTTPS API**

* Copy the **API Key**

#### REST API

* Navigate to `https://[your-domain].vitally.io/integrations/public-api`

* Copy the part of **Basic Auth Header** after the word `Basic` (e.g. if it reads `Basic 1234`, then only copy `1234`)

## üóÑ Supported Objects

| **Object Name** | **Supported?** | **Sync Keys**         | **Create Fields** |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| User            | ‚úÖ              | User ID               | ‚úÖ                 |
| Account         | ‚úÖ              | Account ID            | ‚úÖ                 |
| Organization    | ‚úÖ              | Organization ID       | ‚úÖ                 |
| Track Event     | ‚úÖ              | Any unique identifier | ‚úÖ                 |
| NPS             | üîú             | \-                    | \-                |

Vitally defines User ID and Account ID as the unique identifier for these objects in your system. You are free to use whatever ID you like, but it needs to be unique.

### User Behavior Notes

* Users must have at least one Account in Vitally so **Accounts** is a required field when syncing to users. It's also an Array field so you'll need to provide it an array value or JSON formatted Array.

* Any Account ID values that don't already exist in Vitally will be automatically created.

[Contact us](mailto:support@getcensus.com) if you want Census to support more sync behaviors for Vitally.

## üîç Additional Service Quirks

* Vitally's internal database has a delay between Census completing its upload and having those results reflected in the UI. This delay can be several seconds to several minutes in extreme cases.

* As with all Census syncs, when you unmap a field in Census, we will stop updating those fields. We do not delete them.
