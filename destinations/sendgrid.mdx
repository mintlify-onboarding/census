### 1\. Gather SendGrid API Credentials

To connect Census to SendGrid, you'll need to collect one piece of information:

* API Token

From the home page of your SendGrid account click on **Settings** in the left hand navigation bar then select **API Keys.** From the **API Keys** page you can create a new key or use an existing one.

Create a New API Key in Sendgrid

Please note that SendGrid will only allow you to view your API key once when initially created.

### 3\. Adding Credentials to Census

With the SendGrid API key, return to Census and visit the **Destinations** tab. Click on the **New Destination** button and select **SendGrid** from the menu. Copy and paste the API Key into the dialog and hit save. You should be clear to create a new sync!
