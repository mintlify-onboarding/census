## 🏃‍♀️ Getting Started

In this guide, we will show you how to connect Planhat to Census and create your first sync.

### Prerequisites

* Have your Census account ready. If you need one, [create a Free Trial Census account](https://app.getcensus.com/) now.

* Have your Planhat account ready.

* Have the proper credentials to access to your data source. See our docs for each supported data source for further information:

### 1\. Generate a Planhat API Key

In your Planhat account:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Service Accounts**

2. Create an **API Key**

3. Hold onto this API Key for the next section, you'll need it!

In Planhat, once a token is created, it will appear once and last forever. Make sure to copy and store it securely once generated. It should be over 340 characters long.

### 2\. Connect Planhat to Census

* Head back to Census and navigate to [Destinations](https://app.getcensus.com/destinations).

* Click the New Destination button.

* Select Planhat in the dropdown list.

* Paste your Planhat account's **API Key**. Save your connection and if everything is set up correctly, you should see a successful connection test verifying the connection.

* Paste the region in the region box. If your Planhat app url is `app-us3.planhat.com`, paste **us3**. If your Planhat api endpoint is simply`api.planhat.com`, the value of **default** should be used here.
