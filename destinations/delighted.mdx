### 2\. Create your first Model

Now navigate to the [models page](https://app.getcensus.com/models) in your Census account.

Here you will have to write SQL queries to select the data you want to send to your Delighted account. Your model can be a complex query selecting details about customers and generating metrics, or as simple as a `SELECT * FROM ...`, it's up to you. Once you have created your model, click **Save Model**.

Now head to the [Sync page](https://app.getcensus.com/syncs) and click the **Create a Sync** button.

From there, select your object. Here's an example of how that should look:

You should be able to view your data in Delighted now.
