Complete the OAuth flow to connect to DV360.

## Syncing Audiences

DV360 contains a number of different [audience types](https://developers.google.com/display-video/api/reference/rest/v2/firstAndThirdPartyAudiences#audiencetype) but we only support syncing to `CUSTOMER_MATCH_CONTACT_INFO` and `CUSTOMER_MATCH_DEVICE_ID`. Which audience type we sync to depends on the mappings you select in the sync wizard.

If you want to sync to an audience of type `CUSTOMER_MATCH_DEVICE_ID` then you should only map to the `appId` and `deviceId` fields.

If you want to sync to an audience of type `CUSTOMER_MATCH_CONTACT_INFO` you can map to any field _except_ `appId` and `deviceId`.

You cannot mix audience types in a single sync. If you map to the deviceId field you should not add any customer info fields and vice versa.

If you are syncing customer info and you map to an address field (First Name, Last Name, Country Code, Zip Code) then you must map _all_ the address fields.
