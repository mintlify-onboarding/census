## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Getting Started

In this guide, we will show you how to connect Help Scout to Census.

### Prerequisites

* Have your Census account ready. If you need one, [create a Free Trial Census account](https://app.getcensus.com/) now.

* Have your Help Scout account ready. If you need one, create a [free trial with Help Scout](https://www.helpscout.com/?utm%5Fsource=partner&utm%5Fcampaign=partner-integration-marketplace-listing&utm%5Fcontent=census) now.

* Have your data source properly configured within Census. See our docs for each supported data source for further information:  
   * [Azure Synapse](/sources/azure-synapse)  
   * [Databricks](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/databricks)  
   * [Elasticsearch](/sources/elasticsearch)  
   * [Google BigQuery](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-bigquery)  
   * [Google Sheets](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-sheets)  
   * [MySQL](/sources/mysql)  
   * [Postgres](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/postgres)  
   * [Redshift](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/redshift)  
   * [Rockset](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/rockset)

### Step 1: Connect Help Scout

### Step 2: Create a Model

Now navigate to the [Model section of our Dashboard](https://app.getcensus.com/models).‚Äå

Here you can write a SQL query to select the data you want to see in Help Scout, or you can use a model from a dbt project or a Looker Look. You can also use tables or views already in your data warehouse. Here are some ideas of data you could select

* The Lifetime Value of a customer

* The end date of a user's trial

* The date a user became active in your product

* The number of key activities a user did in your app in the last 7/30 days

In the "**What data do you want to sync?**" section.

* For the Connection, select the data warehouse you've already connected (See Prerequisites).

* Select either **Update or Create** or **Update Only**

For the "**How are source and destination records matched?**" section.

Finally, select the fields you want to update in the Mapper in the "**Which Properties should be updated?**" section. Here simply map the field from your Help Scout instance to the column from your model.

### Syncing to the Customer Object:

**Address:** When updating address fields on a Customer record please note that if one of the below is present in your sync then all have to be included in the sync configuration. This is because all four fields are required by Help Scout to update the address ([Help Scout documentation here](https://developer.helpscout.com/mailbox-api/endpoints/customers/address/create/#request-fields)).

* `City`, `State`, `Postal Code`, `Country`
