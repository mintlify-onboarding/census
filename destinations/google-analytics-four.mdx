## 🏃‍♀️ Getting Started

In this guide, we will show you how to connect Google Analytics 4 to Census and create your first sync.

GA4 has some very interesting behaviors with identifiers, custom fields, and delayed data indexing. If something is confusing, take a look at the [Understanding GA4 Identifiers and Quirks](/destinations/google-analytics-four#things-to-know) section below.

### Prerequisites

* Have your Census account ready. If you need one, [create a Free Trial Census account](https://app.getcensus.com/) now.

* Have your Google Analytics account ready, with an existing **Google Analytics 4 property**. For Universal Analytics, read our docs for the [Google Analytics connector](/destinations/google-analytics)).  
   * You'll also need admin access to create API credentials.

* Have the proper credentials to access to your data source. See our [docs for each supported data source](/sources/overview) for further information.

### Step 1: Add a Data Stream to your Google Analytics 4 property

In order to add a Google Analytics 4 connection, you'll need to create what Google calls a Data Stream. A Data Stream represents events from either a website or a Firebase app. Google describes the process in more detail in [their docs](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/sending-events?client%5Ftype=firebase#required%5Fparameters).

For a Web App:

* First create a new stream or choose an existing one in **Admin** \> **Data Streams**. If creating a new one, specify Web type.

* Then within the selected datastream, visit **Measurement Protocol** \> **Create**

* Copy the **Secret Value** and the **Measurement ID**

For Firebase (iOS/Android) applications:

* First create a new stream or choose an existing one in **Admin** \> **Data Streams**. If creating a new one, specify iOS or Android types.

* Then within the selected datastream, visit **Measurement Protocol** \> **Create**

* Copy the **Secret Value**

* You'll also separately need the Firebase App ID. The identifier for a Firebase app is found in the Firebase console under: **Project Settings** \> **General** \> **Your Apps** \> **App ID**

### Step 2: **Create the Census Connection**

* Navigate to the Census [**Destinations**](https://app.getcensus.com/destinations) page and click **New Destination**

* Select Google Analytics 4 from the drop down list (Not Google Analytics)

* Configure the three settings:  
   * Add the Secret Value in the **API Secret** box of the connection.  
   * Add the Measurement ID or Firebase App ID in **App ID**  
   * Specify the Connection Type: Either **GTag** for websites or **Firebase** for iOS/Android apps.

### Step 3: Create your first sync

The sync will move event data from your warehouse to your Google Analytics 4 property. Before continuing, you may first want to read our article on [Syncing Event Data](/basics/data-models-and-entities/defining-source-data/events).

1. From inside your Census account, navigate to the [**Syncs**](https://app.getcensus.com/syncs) page and click **Add Sync**.

2. Under **What data do you want to sync?**, choose your data warehouse as the **Connection** and your **source:** either a Model from the Census Models tab or a database table.

3. Under **Where do you want to sync data to?**, choose the Google Analytics 4 connection you created in Step 2 as the **Connection**.  
   * Under **Object** select **Event**

4. Under **How should changes to the source be synced?**, **Append** will be automatically selected for the Events destination object.

5. Under How are source records identified?? Select a unique Event ID from your data source. Census needs a unique identifier for each new event to sync.

6. Under **Which properties should be updated?** Map the individual source columns to the destination fields. Some of those fields exist by default, but you may also want to add more custom properties. See below for [more information on how GA4 handles custom fields](/destinations/google-analytics-four#custom-properties-dimensions-and-metrics).

7. Click the **Next** button to see the final preview which will have a recap of what will happen when you start the sync. If you're happy, check the Sync Now checkbox and save the sync.

8. Confirm the data arrives in Google Analytics!

## 🗄 Supported Objects and Behaviors

Learn about all of our sync behaviors in [Core Concepts](/basics/core-concept#sync-behaviors).

| **Object Name** | **Supported?** | **Sync Keys**               | **Behavior**                                |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Event           | ✅              | Unique Event ID             | Append                                      |
| User Properties | ✅              | Client ID orApp Instance ID | Update Only_(ID must already exist in GA4)_ |

Both Event and User Properties support sending custom properties that have already been defined in Google Analytics 4 (see below for more details on the [restrictions on custom properties](/destinations/google-analytics-four#custom-properties-dimensions-and-metrics)). To send custom properties as part of a sync, you can add destination fields via the new Custom Field button as well as the [Properties Bundle structured object](/basics/data-models-and-entities/defining-source-data/events#using-the-properties-bundle) which can be used to send more complex event data structures.

## 💡 Understanding GA4 Identifiers and Quirks

GA4 uses a combination of a half dozen different identifiers to associate the data coming from Census with data being collected directly by Google.

#### The Property and Data Streams

A Property is the "container" like it was in UA, but now in GA4, the property can span across web and mobile apps traffic. It must be set up as a Google Analytics 4 property. If you haven't yet moved, visit [Google's docs](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9744165?hl=en) to learn more about migrating to Google Analytics 4.

A GA4 Property has one or more Data Streams which send data to the property (you'll actually be required to set one up [when creating a new property](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153#stream)). The typical gtag integration will be set up as a Data Stream. You can think of Census as piggybacking or enriching the user activity already happening in those data streams.

Census connects to your GA4 property through a data stream which is uniquely identified by a combination of two of three identifiers provided when you first set up the connection (see [Step 1](/destinations/google-analytics-four#step-1-add-a-data-stream-to-your-google-analytics-4-property)).

* An API **Secret Value** \- This is a typical API Key. It should never be published anywhere public or user facing. Census will use it to securely talk directly to GA4's Measurement API.

* One of: A **Measurement ID** for web/gtag integrations (_not_ a Stream ID) or a **Firebase App ID** (_not_ an App Instance ID - See Below)

With these two, Census can begin adding event and user data to the data stream.

**Identifying Users**

Google Analytics 4 also uses a pair of identifiers to identifier users when syncing user properties and events data.

* A User Pseudo ID which you can think of as uniquely identifying the user on a single device. It's going to be one of:  
   * A **Client ID** for web/gtag connections. This must be collected from the browser by calling `gtag.js('get')` .  
   * An **App Instance ID** for iOS/Android connections. This must be collected from within the app context by calling the equivalent of the `getAppInstanceId()` (the method name varies by language, see [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/sending-events?client%5Ftype=firebase#required%5Fparameters)).

* Optionally, an additional **User ID**. This uniquely identifies the user across devices and can associate their activity across multiple. Note that the [property must be configured to use a User ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9213390#verify%5Fthe%5Freporting%5Fidentity).

#### Custom Properties (Dimensions and Metrics)

Google Analytics supports custom properties they call Dimensions and Metrics, both on the event and the user scope. Their [docs have a lot of detail on this powerful functionality](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10075209?visit%5Fid=638028534254170289-3199207859&rd=1) but there's a few things to keep in mind for Census:

* Before using Custom Dimensions and Metrics in Census, they **must be defined in Google Analytics up 48 hours before they can be used by Census**. Yeah, kinda nuts. It looks like the new Custom fields will start showing up in the first few hours but data may not populate until 24-48 hours later.

* Google limits the number of user and event scoped custom dimensions and metrics. For most GA4 properties, a maximum of 50 custom event dimensions and 25 custom user dimensions are allowed. See [Google's docs for the up to date list of limits](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10075209#limits).

* Avoid syncing "high cardinality" dimensions. [Google defines high cardinality](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12226705) dimension as having more than 500 unique values in a single day. So stick to using dimensions that look like categories or tags.

#### Other Delays

One last thing to keep in mind. GA4 now supports a real-time view of events and, once the above custom dimension restrictions are passed, you should see your events in real-time (ish, up to a minute delayed in some cases). However, there are still some additional delays in reporting:

* For many Google Analytics reports, data imported this way will only shows up if the User ID has been used as a visitor to the property in the last **30 days**.

* Data takes up to **24 hours** to be fully indexed by google
