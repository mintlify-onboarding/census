## 🏃‍♀️ Getting Started

In this guide, we will show you how to connect Google Analytics to Census and create your first sync. The Google Analytics connection uses the Universal Analytics API. For support for Google Analytics 4, take a look at the separate [Google Analytics 4 Connector docs](/destinations/google-analytics-four).

### Prerequisites

* Have your Census account ready. If you need one, [create a Free Trial Census account](https://app.getcensus.com/) now.

* Have your Google Analytics account ready, with admin access to create API-only users and API credentials.

* Have the proper credentials to access to your data source. See our [docs for each supported data source](/sources/overview) for further information.

### Step 1: Configure Your Google Analytics Account

Prior to adding Google Analytics as a Destination in Census you'll need to:

* Create a **Custom Dimension** scoped to the **User** ([Google Documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709829#zippy=%2Cin-this-article))

* Create the **Data Set** ([Google Documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/4524584?ref%5Ftopic=6015090#zippy=%2Cin-this-article))

### 1A: Custom Dimension Set Up

* Navigate to your Google Analytics account. Click into **Admin Settings**\-->Custom **Definitions**\-->**Custom Dimensions**

Create a Custom Dimension

* Create a new custom dimension or view existing ones. If creating a new one click "**New Custom Dimension**" then provide a name and scope it to the **User**.

* Once redirected back to Census select the Google Analytics account you want to sync to

Select a Google Analytics account

### Step 3: Create your first sync

The sync will move data from your warehouse to your Google Analytics account. In this step, you'll define how that will work.

1. From inside your Census account, navigate to the [**Syncs**](https://app.getcensus.com/syncs) page and click **Add Sync**.

2. Under **What data do you want to sync?**, choose your data warehouse as the **Connection** and your **source:** either a Model from the Census Models tab or a database table.

3. Under **Where do you want to sync data to?**, choose the Google Analytics account you created in Step 2 as the **Connection**.  
   * Under **Object** select one of the data sets you created in Step 1.

4. Under **How should changes to the source be synced?**, **Mirror** will be automatically selected. This is the only supported sync behavior for Google Analytics.

5. Under **Which properties should be updated?** Add the fields from your data set you'd like to send to Google Analytics

6. Click the **Next** button to see the final preview which will have a recap of what will happen when you start the sync. If you're happy, check the Sync Now checkbox and save the sync.

7. Confirm the data arrives in Google Analytics!

[Let us know](mailto:support@getcensus.com) if you want Census to support additional sync behaviors for Google Analytics.

## 💡 Things to know

* Google Analytics has limits to how frequently properties are updated per day so you may want to avoid continuous syncs, especially if you’re importing data through other mechanisms

* For many Google Analytics reports, data imported this way will only shows up if the User ID has been used as a visitor to the property in the last **30 days**.

* Data takes up to **24 hours** to be fully indexed by google

[Contact us](mailto:support@getcensus.com) if your use cases don't work with these limitations. We'd love to hear how we can make this connection better in the future!
