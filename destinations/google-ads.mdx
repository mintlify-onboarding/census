## 🏃‍♀️ Getting Started

Just a heads up: We use the new [Google Ads API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/start) as opposed to the older AdWords API.

In this guide, we will show you how to connect Google Ads to Census.

### Prerequisites

* Have your Census account ready. If you need one, [create a Free Trial Census account](https://app.getcensus.com/) now.

* Have your Google Ads account ready.  
   * To create Customer Match syncs, your Google Ads Account will need access to the Customer Match feature. See [Google's Customer Match policy](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6299717?hl=en) for more details.

* Have the proper credentials to access to your data source. See our docs for each supported data source for further information:  
   * [Azure Synapse](/sources/azure-synapse)  
   * [Databricks](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/databricks)  
   * [Elasticsearch](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/elasticsearch)  
   * [Google BigQuery](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-bigquery)

❓

Did my sync work? It says completed but it isn't showing the updated timestamp I expect.

The standard place where bulk files uploading update status doesn't actually update when using Census. Instead, you've gotta hover on a specific card.

Steps to get there:

1. Open your google ads account

2. Navigate to Tools & Settings > Audience Manager

3. Hover over the name of your desired audience in the list.

4. Expand the section labeled `Customers based on email, phone, and/or mailing address uploads`

5. Within that, you'll see a `Last upload` label.

If that date isn't the same time as the most recent sync completed, please reach out via our in-app chat and we will investigate it with you.
