## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Getting Started

In this guide, we will show you how to connect Census to Google BigQuery as a destination.

If you are configuring Google BigQuery as a source (to query data from BigQuery to sync elsewhere), that process is documented separately here: [Google BigQuery as a Source](/sources/google-bigquery)

1. Visit the [Destinations page](https://app.getcensus.com/destinations) and click **\+ New Destination**.

2. Enter your Google Cloud Project ID.

## üîë Permissions and Service Accounts

In order to connect to your BigQuery projects, Census uses a service account. This service account can be provided by you or managed by Census (recommended).

#### Option A: Upload Service Account Key

If you would prefer to have Census to use a service account that you own (instead of our automatically-managed account) to connect to BigQuery, you may provide its service account key JSON file here.

#### Option B: Use Census-managed Service Account

Otherwise, one you save your connection, Census will create a dedicated Google Cloud Service Account for each BigQuery destination. After the previous step, this account was created. To load data into BigQuery, the account needs the appropriate permissions.

Click the _Activate Cloud Shell_ (near top right) icon in Google Cloud and execute the following commands.

* Replace `cs-sandbox-12345` with your Project ID.

* Replace `census-12345abcd1234512345abcdabcd@sutrolabs-giza-production.iam.gserviceaccount.com` with the service account provided in the Census UI.

```

  --role roles/bigquery.dataOwner

[Contact us](mailto:support@getcensus.com) if you want Census to support more Sync behaviors for BigQuery.

## üö¶Network Access Controls

While BigQuery itself doesn't support IP allow lists, you can use [VPC Service Controls](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview) to wrap your BigQuery instance and limit access. You can find Census's set of IP address for your region in [Network Access Controls](/basics/security-and-privacy/regions-and-ip-addresses).

When using VPC Service Controls, you will also need to allow BigQuery unloads to the Census GCP bucket. To do that, you'll need to add [gs://sutrolabs-giza-unloads-production](gs://sutrolabs-giza-unloads-production) in the allow list for BigQuery unloads.
