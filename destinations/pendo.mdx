* Have your Pendo account ready, with create access for Pendo Integration keys.

* Have the proper credentials to access to your data source. See our docs for each supported data source for further information:

### 1\. Collect your Pendo Credentials

Census needs the **Pendo Integration Key** to connect to your Pendo instance. This can be obtained by navigating to `Settings > Subscription Settings > App Details` and copying the `API Key` value.

If you plan to sync Track Events, Census also needs your **Track Event Shared Secret.** This can be obtained by navigating to `Settings > Subscription Settings > App Details` , clicking `Show` next to `Track Event Shared Secret` and then copying the value.

### 1A. Create a Pendo Integration key

Pendo lets you create a number of Integration keys. You should create a new API key for Census rather than reusing an existing one.

Within Pendo's left navigation bar, click the **Settings** ⚙️icon and select **Integrations** from the popup menu. Then, inside the **Integration Keys** tab, click **\+ Add Integration Key**.

Provide a name you'll recognize ("Census" is a good choice) and check the **Allow Write Access**. Save your new key.

Finally, copy the long code you see under **Key**. We'll use that in a minute.

### 2\. Create the Census Connection

Now let's create your new Census connection to Pendo.

1. In the **Settings** tab, create a new Pendo destination in Census.

2. Copy and paste your new Pendo Integration Key, and optionally, your Track Event Shared Secret.
